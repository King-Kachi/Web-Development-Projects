<h1>The Best Movies According to KingK</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies (Animes) so far.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice)</h3>
<p>Were do I even begin, a truly heartfelt and touching movie. It is important to treat others with kindness and respect, and also learn to forgive not just others but ourselves.</p>
<h3>Josee to Tora to Sakana-tachi (Josee, the Tiger and the Fish)</h3>
<p>This is an epic and wonderful story. How far are you willing to go to achieve your dreams. Face your fears head on so you may overcome them.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the beautiful images.</p>
